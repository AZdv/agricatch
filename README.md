Data aggregation library for Django


This library started as an algorithm I wrote in Vanilla PHP, then moved to Yii. <br />
Finally I decided to rewrite the entire thing on Python (3rd time's a charm), using Django.

To get some sense into what's going on, try the following:

`python manage.py syncdb` <br />
`python manage.py doimport gizmodo`


More to follow!
